class USingredientConverter
	# 
	# * The method "convert" sole reponsibility is to convert the units-from parameter into the units-to parameter.
	# * It will always return "4 ounces" as it is a stub as my face melted off attempting to get a hash inside a hash value by the deadline
	# * I will make this more useful shortly

		return '4 ounces'
